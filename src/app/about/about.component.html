            When I started college I had no idea what I wantend to do. I was
            taking random classes while on a scholarship that payed my tuition
            at a community colleg in Southeast Missouri. I took classes like
            film photography, archaeology, etc. I was trying to find something
            that I liked enough to pursue a career in. One semester, I took an
            entry course to Python without the slightest clue what coding was.
            Little did I know, this would be my career of choice. During the
            class I fell in love with the process of figuring out how to tell a
            computer to do what you want. This led me to pursue a degree in
            Computer Science. I looked at other trade schools and community
            colleges to find one to transfer to, so that I could still use my
            scholarship. I found a trade school in Central Missouri, packed my
            stuff, and went. This school introduced me to the world of
            programming. During my time there I learned the basics of many
            things like: C#, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I took all
            these courses in my first two semesters. Towards the end of my
            second semester the administrators told the students to look for a
            place to do a required internship, so that we didn't have to do it
            "after" we graduated. This threw me for a loop. In rural Missouri
            there are not a lot of tech jobs which, in turn, means there is not
            a lot of internships. As I looked around and applied for many, I
            received "We decided to move on with our search" emails for every
            single one. This was devastating. What was I going to do. Around
            this time my dad sent me a link to a webinar that was happening in
            the next week with a tech company that I never heard of that was
            close to my home town. I attended the webinar, which was for their
            coding bootcamp ironically, and contacted one of the developers that
            spoke during it. I reached out to him with skepticism, looking for
            an internship opportunity. He responded letting me know he would
            talk to his boss and get back with me. I still had a month left in
            my semester so I wasn't pressed for time. After a long month I
            started to pack my things to head back home for the summer, still
            hadn't heard back about the internship. So, I reached out to the
            developer once again and received a response asking me to come to
            the office for an interview. Relief came over me even though I
            didn't know if it was for sure. I went to the interview and we
            ironed out the details and I was to start that day. I came on and
            the developer I reached out to took me under his wings and showed me
            the ropes. During the internship I learned, what felt like, more
            than I had learned at school. I was able to learn how real-world web
            development was done. Frameworks, Git, Pull Requests, you name it, I
            learned it. The internship was a great opportunity for me and I was
            honestly dreading going back to school. Close to the end of my
            internship I walked in to the office and I was asked if I wanted a
            job teaching what I had learned. "Am I qualified for this?" I asked
            myself and the developers I worked with. They reassured me and I
            told them I would think about it. Even though I did not want to go
            back to school, I did not know what the best option was for me. I
            talked to my parents, thought about it, and accepted the job. My
            first tech job! I dropped out of school and felt good about it. I
            have now been a Code Coach for about a year and I never looked back.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In conclusion, everyone has their own path. Had I not dropped out of
            school I would've gotten my degree and ended up in, most likely, a
            similar place. So do what you think is best for you right here,
            right now and don't look back.

            I have had many hobbies over the years, however there have only been
            a few that stuck around. I used to be a freelance
            videographer/photographer, which started as a hobby. That has been a
            hobby of mine for about 5 years or so. I have shot personal videos
            just for the fun of it. Whenever I travel I always take my camera.
            The process of getting the right shot, bringing them up in LightRoom
            to edit them, and sharing them with my friends is my favorite part
          </p>
          <br />

            More recent hobbies of mine have been archery and leather crafting.
            I started to shoot bows because it seemed really cool. I shoot a
            recurve traditional bow and when I bought it the store owner told me
            I might need a finger tab. A finger tab is a piece of leather that
            goes over the fingers you use to pull the string back. He sold me
            one but it is big enough to rest my pinky on, however I dont like
            that. So I bought a leather kit to make a new one that fit my hand
            perfectly. This started my leather craft venture. The process of
            tracing, cutting, punching the stitch holes, and hand stitching is a
            therapeutic process. You can really focus and calml down after a
            long day while working with leather.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am the type of person that thinks of something and wants to do it.
            So I go through many hobbies, but these are the few that have stuck
            around linger than a couple months.
